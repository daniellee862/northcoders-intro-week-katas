// Predict -> Observe -> Explain

// It is great practice for you to start working out what code will do before it is even executed by the computer.

// In the snippet below try to work out what will be printed to the console and then execute the file with Node to see if you were right :)

const firstName = "Toni";
firstName = "Tony";

//there is no console log so nothing.

//I still got the error...of course we will still get the error, and it was type error.
