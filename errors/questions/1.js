try {
  let name = "Anat";
  nam;
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}

//Not sure what is even being attempted here, we declare name and assign it a value...then we have 'nam' underneath....syntax error?

//it was a reference error, how did it know I wanted to reference a variable and I hadn't misspelled a js keyword or something?
