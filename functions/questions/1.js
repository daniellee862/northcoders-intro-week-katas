// Predict -> Observe -> Explain

// It is essential for you to start working out what the code will do before it is executed by the computer. In the snippet below try to work out what will be printed to the console and then execute the file with Node to see if you were right :)

function double(num) {
  num * 2;
}

const result1 = double(10);
console.log(result1);

//function declaration; num * 2. FUNCTION DOESNT RETURN ANYTHING
// variable declaration with the value of the output of double...which is nothing
//console log of result one will return undefined?
//yep. undefined
